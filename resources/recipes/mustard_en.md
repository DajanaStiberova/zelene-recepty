Mix apple cider vinegar with water and add mustard seeds.
<br/>
<br/>
Leave to soak for 2 to 3 days. The mustard seeds will absorb almost all the liquid and will start to smell like you’re about to make the best mustard on the planet.
<br/>
<br/>
Add mustard mix to a blender, together with the rest of the ingredients, and blitz until you get a smooth consistency.  If you think it’s too thick, add 2 TBSP of water at a time and continue to blend until you get it smooth.
>Chili flakes depending on how hot you want the mustard you can use mild chili flakes or hot ones.

Spoon into jars, leaving no air bubbles if you can, and keep covered in the fridge.
<br/>
<br/>
Mustard should keep well in the fridge, for up to few months.
