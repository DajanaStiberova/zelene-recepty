Grate carrot (give it a squeeze with paper towel to remove a little excess moisture)

Blend all ingredients in a high speed blender till very smooth. Add more water as needed; you want a pancake batter consistency.
<br/>
<br/>
Spread wrap batter evenly onto two Teflex-lined dehydrator sheets. Dehydrate at 105 degrees for about 3 1/2 hours, or until the tops are firm and you can peel the wraps away from the nonstick sheets (if they’re a mess when you try to peel them off, keep dehydrating).
<br/>
<br/>
Flip your Teflex sheet (with the wrap on it) upside down onto the mesh sheet beneath, and carefully peel back the Teflex till the wrap has been flipped onto its other side. Continue dehydrating another 1 1/2 hours or so, checking in on the wraps every so often. You want them to ultimately be firm and sturdy, but still flexible, and you don’t want the edges to start cracking too much when you bend them (they’ll definitely crack a little no matter what you do).
<br/>
<br/>
When the wraps have finished dehydrating, you can use a pizza wheel or knife to cut them into 6 rectangles. You can also cut away some of the edges, if they’ve gotten very hard.

>Store these overnight in a plastic bag or airtight container. This will get rid of some of the brittleness that the wraps may have taken on in the dehydrating process. When you’re ready to use them, simply stuff them with fillings of choice, and get eating!

I chose sweet potato, avocado, red cabbage, greens and [tahini dressing](recipe?Id=12&lang=en).
