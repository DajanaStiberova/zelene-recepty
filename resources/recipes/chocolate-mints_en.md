First, melt all the coconut oil until itâ€™s just barely melted but not hot.
<br/>
<br/>
In a medium bowl, mix in almond flour, 1/2 of the coconut oil, salt, 4 tablespoon of agave and peppermint extract. Form flat patties from the almond flour mint mixture.

>If it gets too soft to work with, place in the refrigerator for about 10-15 minutes to harden slightly.

Meanwhile, in another small bowl, mix 2 tablespoon of agave, 1/2 coconout oil, cocoa powder and drizzle on top of the mint patties. (you may need two coats to cover completely, place in the refrigerator to harden then add one more layer of raw chocolate) Return to the refrigerator to set completely once they are fully coated, or the freezer for just a few minutes to harden and enjoy even faster
<br/>
<br/>
Serve straight from the refrigerator.
