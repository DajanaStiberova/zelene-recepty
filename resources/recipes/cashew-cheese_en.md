Soake the cashews for 4 hours in 3 cups filtered water.
<br/>
<br/>
Blend all ingredients in a high-powered blender until smooth. Start by adding 1/2 cup water, blend. Add more water, a tablespoon at a time, if necessary. Texture should be smooth and very thick. Taste and adjust salt.
<br/>
<br/>
Set up your cheesecloth and pour the mixture into the center of your cloth. Wrap the cheese mixture in a tight bundle and tie with a rubber band or string.Cut two holes in the top end of the bundle so that you can suspend the bundle over your deep bowl/bucket/pitcher.
<br/>
<br/>
Allow your cheese to drain at room temperature for 2-4 hours. Some cheese mixtures will drain a bit of liquid off and some will simply dry out and the water will soak into the cloth.
<br/>
<br/>
Finished cheese can be stored in the refrigerator for at least a week.
